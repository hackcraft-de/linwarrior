Enhanced Internals
- Object-role interdependencies split into decoupled bound-components
- Glued component-attributes through bindings in objects
- Component'ified Weapons and other functional structures
- Replaced weapon mount matrix with quaternion+position for effective binding
- Cleaned up model scaling

This release has some visual highlights like the trees, smoke and new terrain.
But there are major changes under the hood stepping beyond the object-with-roles concept:
Object-with-components. But there is more to the new internals than just
"hey, objects are built of components" (as if that would be new). No, it is how
components are coupled or rather decoupled. A solution to this dilemma are
chip-like components which only act on their own state without any method-calls
to any other component. Interaction is achieved by binding input and output variables
(ie. instance member variables) of two components at the object level. Like
soldering chips to a printed circuit board. The idea itself isn't new.
This concept of binding components is precedented by hardware-description-language's
Entity+Portmap and by Bean+BeansBinding.

Enhanced Internals
- Changed message groups to dispatching objects
- Refactored/Cleaned a lot of previous work (esp. PCG code)
Enhanced Usability
- Added simple loading screen with key-hints

This release turns out to be a lot about graphics but there are some important steps towards a game.
Notably there is some beginning of a story, a mission and finally a loadscreen.
Behind the scenes there where changes for handling game events and towards an integrated editor.
And yet there is a long way to go.
As for the next release?
Maybe something towards an editmode?
Maybe some shiny new vehicles?
Maybe some multitasking?
